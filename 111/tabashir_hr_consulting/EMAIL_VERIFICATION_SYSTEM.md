# Email Verification System Implementation

This document outlines the email verification system implemented for the Tabashir HR Consulting application.

## Overview

The system requires email verification for users registering with credentials (email/password) while automatically verifying users who sign up through Google OAuth.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Verification for Google OAuth**
- Users who sign up with Google are automatically marked as verified
- No additional verification step required for OAuth users

### 2. **Manual Verification for Credential Users**
- Users registering with email/password must verify their email before logging in
- Verification emails are sent automatically upon registration
- Users cannot log in until their email is verified

### 3. **Existing User Protection**
- All existing users are automatically marked as verified to prevent service disruption
- Migration `20250623151227_mark_existing_users_verified` handles this

## Components Modified

### Auth Actions (`actions/auth/index.ts`)
- **`onLogin`**: Now checks if email is verified before allowing login
- **`onCandidateRegistration`**: Sends verification email instead of immediately signing in user
- **`sendVerificationEmail`**: Creates verification token and sends email
- **`resendVerificationEmail`**: Allows users to request new verification emails
- **`verifyEmail`**: Handles email verification when user clicks link

### NextAuth Configuration (`app/utils/auth.ts`)
- **`signIn` callback**: Automatically verifies Google OAuth users
- **`authorize` function**: Blocks unverified credential users from logging in

### UI Components
- **Login Form**: Shows verification status and resend options
- **Registration Form**: Displays success message after registration
- **Verification Page**: Standalone page for managing email verification

### API Routes
- **`/api/auth/verify-email`**: Handles email verification links

## User Flow

### Registration Flow
1. User submits registration form
2. Account is created (but not verified)
3. Verification email is sent
4. User sees success message and is redirected to login
5. User clicks verification link in email
6. Email is marked as verified
7. User can now log in

### Login Flow
1. User attempts to log in
2. System checks if email is verified
3. If not verified: Shows resend verification options
4. If verified: User is logged in successfully

### Google OAuth Flow
1. User signs in with Google
2. System automatically marks email as verified
3. User is logged in immediately

## Email Configuration

The system uses the following environment variables for email sending:
- `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server hostname
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: Sender email address
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Email account password

## Security Features

- **Token Expiration**: Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
- **One-time Use**: Verification tokens are deleted after use
- **Secure Links**: Verification URLs include random tokens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of expired/invalid tokens

## Database Changes

- Existing `emailVerified` field in User model is utilized
- Existing `VerificationToken` model is used for token storage
- Migration ensures existing users remain verified

## Error Handling

- Invalid/expired tokens redirect to login with error message
- Failed email sending deletes the user account (for new registrations)
- Clear error messages for various failure scenarios

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New user registration sends verification email
- [ ] Verification link successfully verifies email
- [ ] Unverified users cannot log in
- [ ] Verified users can log in normally
- [ ] Google OAuth users are automatically verified
- [ ] Resend verification works correctly
- [ ] Expired tokens are handled gracefully
- [ ] Existing users can still log in

## Future Enhancements

- Email template customization
- Multiple verification methods (SMS, etc.)
- Account recovery through email verification
- Bulk email verification status management

## Support

For issues with email verification:
1. Check SMTP configuration
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check email deliverability
4. Review application logs for errors
